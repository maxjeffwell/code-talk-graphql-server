    ## Authentication
    Authentication is handled via httpOnly cookies. Use the `signIn` mutation to authenticate,
    and the cookies will be automatically included in subsequent requests.

    ## Rate Limiting
    - Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
    - API requests: 100 per minute
    - GraphQL queries: 60 per minute

    ## Query Complexity
    Maximum query complexity is limited to 1000 points to prevent DoS attacks.
